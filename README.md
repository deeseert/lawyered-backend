# README
### Description
"Lawyered" is a Full-Stack client-focused platform built with the idea of filling the gaps in the traditional legal sector such as the lack of transparency and inflated legal fees. 

Clients can search for a lawyer based on their own needs, filtering them based on rating, price, and location. Clients can get in touch with lawyers or book an appointment via the platform.

"Lawyered" is built using Ruby on Rails for the back-end and React.js, together with CSS and HTML for the front-end.
